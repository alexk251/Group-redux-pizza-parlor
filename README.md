## Description

    Group project where we were given 5 hours to complete a CRUD and implement material UI for the first time.
    Done with 3 other students this was the time when the hiccups of git branching and merge workflow didn't happen.
    This enhanced workflow enabled us to finish our project within the alloted time and also some time to explore material UI.
    This was also our first time to tackle a full project with redux storing the bulk of states.
    Communicating nameing conventions with the group and making an ample to do list really paid off in this group.
